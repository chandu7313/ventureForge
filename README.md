## What Makes VentureForge AI Different?

## Architecture

VentureForge AI uses a highly parallelized, event-driven multi-agent architecture:

1. **User Input**: User submits idea via Next.js frontend.
2. **API & Queue**: NestJS API validates input and queues a job in BullMQ.
3. **Stage 1 (Parallel Orchestration)**: The `AiOrchestrator` spins up 7 specialist agents in parallel:
   - Market Agent
   - Competitor Agent
   - Product Agent
   - Business Formation Agent
   - Compliance Agent
   - Financial Agent
   - Operations Agent
4. **Stage 2 (Synthesis)**: The VC Agent synthesizes the outputs of Stage 1 into final scores and pitch materials.
5. **Streaming**: Progress is streamed back to the frontend in real-time via WebSockets.
6. **Storage**: Complete Business DNA is stored as structured JSON in PostgreSQL.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed diagrams and workflow documentation.
